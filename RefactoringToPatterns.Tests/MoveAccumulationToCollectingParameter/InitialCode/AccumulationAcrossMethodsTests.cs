/*
* On page 315 Joshua makes the statement that Java's String would not allow you to accumulate results across methods.
* I was pretty sure of what he meant, and was also pretty certain that was the case with C# as well... but I wanted to
* check it so I wrote this small test class to explore that.
* 
* I've left a failing test in here, Accumulate_With_String_Does_Not_Work_Across_Method_Calls. This shows that passing
* a String into a method, and then seemingly mutating that string inside of that method... does not mutate the original
* String passed in.
*
* This is not the case with the second test that uses a StringBuilder,
* Accumulate_With_StringBuilder_Does_Work_Accross_Method_Calls.
*
* This shows the difference in how these types are passed. You may say... of course! I wanted to leave this behind
* for anyone that hit that part of the book and maybe didn't have an understanding of what Joshua was talking about.
